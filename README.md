# PestOn
The ontology PestOn transforms a public pesticide register, the Italian Ministry of Health pesticide authorization database of over 16,000 pesticide products registered during the last 50 years, into an equivalent ontology schema, along with import files containing an RDF graph database.
PestOn directly access pesticide product information and includes information about active ingredients contained in pesticide products, roles, hazards, production companies, authorization status, and regulatory dates. 
These pieces of information can support agri-food stakeholders in classifying information in the domain of pesticide products and their active ingredients, while reducing unnecessary repetition in research. 
PestOn can support the addition of food attributes in the domains of human health, resource depletion, and eco-social impact, turning the spotlight on each possible improper use of pesticide products.
